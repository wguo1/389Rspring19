Ethically this is a really realistic situation that could be applicable even if it wasn’t
dealing with cyber security. For example withholding faulty earnings towards investors would be
a parallel situation to the ECU one. There’s obviously a problem, however is it worth the time
and risk to not fix it. For the ECU problem the danger is catastrophic. I think the first solution
would be to tell the supervisor or others. It’s simply too risky to release a product that is as
critical as the engine of a car. Though obviously it would be ridiculous to make a blanket
statement that all flaws need to be fixed. If a toy for instance is missing something minute than
the intended fixup cost wouldn’t be worth it. But if the ECU fails, there is not only risk of
physical and bodily harm but also lawsuits and a public relations nightmare. However if
management won’t do anything about it, I think it is a serious enough to garner a outside party.
Whistleblowers are protected by the US government so it should absolutely not be a problem.
Otherwise turning a blind eye is just as bad as committing the crime itself. I might be biased
because I have a strong moral compass but I think when lives are at stake, there is no reason to
do everything in your power to stop it. I wouldn’t however go and try to solve the problem if I
didn’t have the qualifications. Chances are that’ll only make it worse and make you as guilty as
the company. Telling the right authorities and making sure that enforcement is put into place is
the role of everybody on the project. Otherwise the consequences could be dire.
